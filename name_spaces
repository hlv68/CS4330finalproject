##C++
*Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects.
Symbols declared inside a namespace block are placed in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named symbols in other scopes.
Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.

##java
*Java doesn't use this term but there is similar concept which is used Java which is called packages.
Packages are used to organize files or public types to avoid 
type conflicts. 
Package constructs can be mapped to a file system.
