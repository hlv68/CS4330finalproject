## C++
* Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects.
* Symbols declared inside a namespace block are placed in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named symbols in other scopes.
  Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.

## JAVA
* Java doesn't use this term but there is similar concept which is used Java which is called packages.
* Packages are used to organize files or public types to avoid 
  type conflicts. 
* Package constructs can be mapped to a file system.
